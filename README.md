# barebeauty
Bare Beauty is an e-commerce website catering specifically to different skin types. It provides personalized recommendations through a quiz which can serve as a game-changer for many who struggle to find the right skincare products that work for them. The central idea is to provide a platform where customers can easily buy skincare essentials based on their skin type and issues.

This is built using Django for the backend, SQLite for the database, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for the front end
